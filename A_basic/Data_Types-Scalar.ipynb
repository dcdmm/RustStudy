    "Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. Signed and unsigned refer to whether it‚Äôs possible for the number to be negative‚Äîin other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned). It‚Äôs like writing numbers on paper: when the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however, when it‚Äôs safe to assume the number is positive, it‚Äôs shown with no sign. Signed numbers are stored using two‚Äôs complement(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each signed variant can store numbers from $-(2^{n - 1})$ to $2^{n - 1} - 1$ inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from $-(2^7)$ to $2^7 - 1$, which equals -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to $2^n - 1$, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to $2^8 - 1$, which equals 0 to 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as ‚Äúarch‚Äù: 64 bits if you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you‚Äôre on a 32-bit architecture.\n",

The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs it‚Äôs roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision. All floating-point types are signed."
