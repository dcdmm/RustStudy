    Note that we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.

    Rustâ€™s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive.

    A [char] is effectively a UCS-4 / UTF-32 string of length 1.
